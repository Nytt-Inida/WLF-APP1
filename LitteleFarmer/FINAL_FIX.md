# 🔧 Final Fix - Build in Xcode Directly

## ❌ The Problem

The `wakelock_plus` plugin's `messages.g.h` file isn't being generated during Flutter CLI build. This is a known issue with some Flutter plugins.

---

## ✅ Solution: Build in Xcode

Xcode sometimes handles code generation better than Flutter CLI. Let's try building directly in Xcode:

### Step 1: Open Xcode Workspace

```bash
cd /Users/nytt/Downloads/WLF-APP-main/LitteleFarmer
open ios/Runner.xcworkspace
```

### Step 2: In Xcode

1. **Select your iPhone** from the device menu (top toolbar)
2. **Product → Clean Build Folder** (Cmd + Shift + K)
3. **Wait for clean to complete**
4. **Product → Build** (Cmd + B)
5. **Watch for errors** - if it builds successfully:
6. **Product → Run** (Cmd + R)

## 🔄 Alternative: Try Flutter Upgrade

If Xcode doesn't work, try updating Flutter:

```bash
flutter upgrade
flutter pub get
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
flutter run
```

---

## 💡 Why This Happens

The `messages.g.h` file is generated by Pigeon (Flutter's code generation tool). Sometimes:
- Flutter CLI doesn't trigger code generation properly
- Xcode's build system handles it better
- The plugin needs a newer Flutter version

---

## ✅ Summary

**The issue:** Missing generated file in wakelock_plus  
**The fix:** Build in Xcode (handles code generation better)  
**Steps:** Open Xcode → Clean → Build → Run

**Try building in Xcode - it often fixes code generation issues!** 🚀
