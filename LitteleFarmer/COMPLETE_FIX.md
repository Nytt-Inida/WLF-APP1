# 🔧 Complete Fix - Missing messages.g.h File

## ❌ The Problem

The `wakelock_plus` plugin is missing its generated platform channel file. This needs a complete regeneration.

---

## ✅ Complete Solution

### Step 1: Remove All Generated Files and Symlinks

```bash
cd /Users/nytt/Downloads/WLF-APP-main/LitteleFarmer

# Clean Flutter
flutter clean

# Remove all build artifacts
rm -rf build
rm -rf ios/.symlinks
rm -rf ios/Pods
rm -rf ios/Flutter/Flutter.framework
rm -rf ios/Flutter/Flutter.podspec
rm -f ios/Podfile.lock
rm -rf .dart_tool
```

### Step 2: Regenerate Everything

```bash
# Get dependencies (this recreates .symlinks and generates plugin files)
flutter pub get

# Install pods
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
```

### Step 3: Build with Verbose Output

```bash
flutter run --verbose
```

The `--verbose` flag will show detailed output to help identify the issue.

## 🚀 Complete Commands (Copy All)

```bash
cd /Users/nytt/Downloads/WLF-APP-main/LitteleFarmer
flutter clean
rm -rf build ios/.symlinks ios/Pods ios/Flutter/Flutter.framework ios/Flutter/Flutter.podspec ios/Podfile.lock .dart_tool
flutter pub get
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
flutter run --verbose
```

---

## 🔄 Alternative: Build in Xcode

If Flutter CLI still fails, try building directly in Xcode:

```bash
cd /Users/nytt/Downloads/WLF-APP-main/LitteleFarmer
open ios/Runner.xcworkspace
```

In Xcode:
1. **Product → Clean Build Folder** (Cmd + Shift + K)
2. **Select your iPhone** from device menu
3. **Product → Build** (Cmd + B)
4. Check for errors in the Issue Navigator
5. If build succeeds, **Product → Run** (Cmd + R)

---

## 💡 Why This Happens

The `messages.g.h` file is generated by Flutter's code generation tool (`pigeon` or similar) when you run `flutter pub get`. Sometimes these files don't get generated properly, especially after cleaning.

---

## ✅ Summary

**The issue:** Missing generated platform channel file  
**The fix:** Complete clean + remove symlinks + regenerate  
**Commands:** Clean everything → Remove .symlinks → `flutter pub get` → `pod install` → `flutter run --verbose`
