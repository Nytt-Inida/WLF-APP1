# ✅ Simulator Installation - This is Normal!

## Yes, This is Correct! 👍

When Xcode installs iOS 26.2 support, it installs **both**:
1. ✅ **iOS Runtime** - Needed for your physical iPhone
2. ✅ **iOS Simulator** - For testing on your Mac (bonus feature)

**This is completely normal!** The simulator installation is part of the iOS support package.

---

## 🎯 What This Means

- ✅ **Your physical iPhone will work** once installation completes
- ✅ **You'll also get a simulator** (useful for quick testing)
- ✅ **Everything is installing correctly**

---

## 📱 After Installation

Once the installation finishes:

1. **Your iPhone will be available** in the device selector
2. **You can select your physical iPhone** (not the simulator)
3. **Build and install** on your real device

## 💡 About Simulators

The iOS Simulator is a bonus - it lets you:
- Test your app on your Mac (no iPhone needed)
- Test different iPhone models and screen sizes
- Quick testing during development

**But you can still use your physical iPhone!** Just make sure to select your actual iPhone (not "iPhone Simulator") from the device list.

## ✅ What to Do Now

1. **Let it finish installing** (10-30 minutes)
2. **Wait for completion message**
3. **Select your physical iPhone** from device list
4. **Click Run (▶️)**

---

## 🎯 Key Point

**The simulator installation is part of iOS 26.2 support.** Once it's done, you'll have everything you need to build for your physical iPhone!

**Just wait for it to finish, then select your iPhone and build!** 🚀
