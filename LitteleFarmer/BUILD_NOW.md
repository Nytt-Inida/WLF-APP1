## 🎯 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Select Your Physical iPhone

1. **Look at the device selector dropdown** (top toolbar, where you see "iOS 26.2 Simulator")
2. **Click on the device selector** to open the dropdown
3. **Find your iPhone** in the list - it should show:
   - "iPhone" or "iPhone 12 Pro Max"
   - Your iPhone's name (if you named it)
   - **NOT** "iPhone Simulator" - that's the simulator!
4. **Click on your physical iPhone** to select it

**Important:** Make sure you select your **physical iPhone**, not the simulator!

### Step 2: Build and Install

1. **Click the Run button (▶️)** in the top-left of Xcode
   - OR press `Cmd + R` on your keyboard
2. **Wait for the build** (first time takes 5-10 minutes)
   - You'll see progress in the status bar
   - Watch the bottom panel for build messages
   - Be patient - first build takes time!

### Step 3: Trust Certificate on iPhone (First Time Only)

After the app installs on your iPhone:

1. **On your iPhone**, you may see a message about untrusted developer
2. Go to: **Settings → General → VPN & Device Management**
3. Tap on **"Nytt TVM"** or your Apple ID
4. Tap **"Trust"**
5. Confirm by tapping **"Trust"** again
6. **Go back to home screen** and tap the app icon to launch
